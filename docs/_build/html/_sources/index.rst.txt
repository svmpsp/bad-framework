Welcome to BAD: Benchmarking for Anomaly Detection!
===================================================

BAD is a benchmarking framework for unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms.

Some of BAD's features include:

- a collection of benchmark :ref:`data sets <pages/datasets>` from the literature.
- simple usage via the :ref:`command line interface <pages/usage>`.
- a convenient interface for :ref:`hyperparameter tuning <pages/parameters>`.
- out-of-the-box support for :ref:`distributed processing <pages/execution>`.
- extensibility via custom python modules implementing the :ref:`Candidate API <pages/candidate>`.

BAD is built with lots of ‚ù§ and Python.
